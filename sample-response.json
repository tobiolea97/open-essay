    "rewritten_version": "As population increases and cities become bigger, so does the traffic in the streets. That is why citizens of big metropolises are trying to replace their cars with alternative means of transport. In recent years, bicycles have become a popular and cheap alternative for traveling to work. This essay will develop different aspects of the subject and provide an opinion on whether it is a good alternative for commuting.\n\nAs mentioned before, the number of cars on the streets (and therefore the traffic) seems to increase all the time. This results in people spending an extra shift every week just commuting; recent studies have shown that people from big towns who travel to work by car spend an average of 9 hours per week stuck in traffic.\n\nApart from time consumption, another aspect to consider when thinking about means of transport in cities has to do with safety. Means of transport such as motorcycles and bicycles expose riders to the risk of suffering serious accidents, even if they take safety measures like wearing helmets. Moreover, car drivers seem not to really care about the welfare of cyclist riders, making it an even more dangerous alternative.\n\nOn the contrary, authorities of these big cities are investing a great amount of money in infrastructure for cyclists. Cities such as New York, Amsterdam, and Paris have doubled the length of the bike lanes in the last few years. Other cities like Buenos Aires and Berlin are providing people with free bike rides: they can pick up a bike from different spots in the city, use it, and drop it off at a different spot.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that cycling to work is a very good alternative as long as the distance is reasonable and safety measures are taken. This will not only help reduce traffic jams but also decrease the amount of greenhouse gases. Furthermore, it will provide you with a daily dose of exercise, which is an important aspect."
