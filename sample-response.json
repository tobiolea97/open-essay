  "rewritten_version": "As the population increases and cities grow larger, so does the traffic on the streets. That is why citizens of big metropolises are trying to replace their cars with alternative means of transport. In recent years, the bicycle has become a popular and affordable option for commuting to work. This essay will explore different aspects of the subject and offer an opinion on whether cycling is a suitable alternative for commuting.\n\nThe escalation of cars on the streets (and consequently, traffic) appears to be perpetual. As a result, we find ourselves spending an additional shift each week just commuting. Recent studies have revealed that individuals from major cities who travel to work by car spend an average of 9 hours per week trapped in traffic.\n\nApart from the time aspect, safety is another crucial consideration when deliberating on transportation options within cities. Modes of transport such as motorcycles and bicycles expose riders to the risk of serious accidents, even when safety precautions like wearing helmets are taken. Moreover, car drivers seemingly disregard the well-being of cyclists, further exacerbating the peril.\n\nOn the flip side, city authorities are investing substantial amounts of money in cycling infrastructure. Metropolises like New York, Amsterdam, and Paris have doubled the length of bike lanes in recent years. Other cities such as Buenos Aires and Berlin offer free bike-sharing services, allowing individuals to pick up bikes from various locations, use them, and drop them off elsewhere.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that cycling to work is a commendable alternative as long as the distance is manageable and safety precautions are observed. This not only aids in alleviating traffic congestion but also reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, it provides a daily dose of exercise, which is a vital component of a healthy lifestyle."
