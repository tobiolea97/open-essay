                    As technology grows bigger, we become stiller. It seems that most of our daily tasks <wrong>requires</wrong> <right>require</right> to be sitting in front of a computer,
                    and people do not include excersise on their schedule. This essay will develop the aspects of nowaday lifestyle,
                    the benefits of including regular excersise, and provide an opinion on how we <wrong>can</wrong> <right>could</right> implement it

                <p>
                    Modern economy has taken us to a sedentary lifestyle. Both when working and studying we spent a significant amount of time sitting
                    at a desktop. This lead us to make a lot of mental work, without doing any physical effort. The problem is that after of long hours
                    of thinking, people are often too tired to engage in outdoors activities or sports, and they search for more screen-based activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, is not an unknown fact that doing exercise regularly has a lot of benefits. Studies have shown that people who runs twice
                    or thre times a weeks have a deeper sleep during night, which help them to rest better. On the other hand, people who started practicing
                    some kind of sport assert to have had their self esteem improved after some months of trainning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One point to remark is that taking up some sport activities is easier than what people think. A common belief is that doing regular excersise
                    implies hard work at gym, or running several kilometers per day. However, a simple 10-minutes walk is enough as a starting point; what is
                    important finding an activity that appeals to us and, little by little, increase the amount of time we spent practising it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a conclusion, it is clear that both students and think workers spent a lot of time sitting on they chairs, and that including
                    some sports on their agenda is a must do. The good think is that finding an free-time activities that does not imply stay sitting
                    in front of a screen will always be up to us.

                <h3>Paragraph 1</h3>
                <p>
                The introduction is clear in presenting the topic of commuting alternatives due to increasing traffic in cities. It would be beneficial to add a more precise thesis statement to indicate the viewpoint of the essay.
                </p>
                <h3>Paragraph 2</h3>
                <p>
                    This paragraph provides relevant information about the transportation issues in big cities.
                    The argument is developed logically, but there are some grammar mistakes that need to be corrected.
                </p>
                <h3>Paragraph 3</h3>
                <p>
                    The paragraph discusses safety aspects related to alternative means of transport.
                    However, some ideas could be expressed more clearly to strengthen the argument.
                </p>
                <h3>Paragraph 4</h3>
                <p>
                The paragraph presents a counterargument regarding infrastructure for cyclists.
                It is insightful, but there are misspelled words that need to be addressed for better coherence.
                </p>
                <h3>Paragraph 5</h3>
                <p>
                The conclusion summarizes the main points effectively and presents a clear opinion.
                The paragraph could be enhanced by providing more specific examples or statistics
                to support the argument.
