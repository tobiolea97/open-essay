          <h3>Paragraph 1</h3>
          <p>The introduction is clear in presenting the topic of commuting alternatives due to increasing traffic in cities. It would be beneficial to add a more precise thesis statement to indicate the viewpoint of the essay.</p>

            Modern economy has taken us to a sedentary lifestyle. Both when working and studying we spent a significant amount of time sitting
            at a desktop. This lead us to make a lot of mental work, without doing any physical effort. The problem is that after of long hours
            of thinking, people are often too tired to engage in outdoors activities or sports, and they search for more screen-based activities.

          <h3>Paragraph 2</h3>
            This paragraph provides relevant information about the transportation issues in big cities.
            The argument is developed logically, but there are some grammar mistakes that need to be corrected.
        </div>
        <div className="paragraph">
            However, is not an unknown fact that doing exercise regularly has a lot of benefits. Studies have shown that people who runs twice
            or thre times a weeks have a deeper sleep during night, which help them to rest better. On the other hand, people who started practicing
            some kind of sport assert to have had their self esteem improved after some months of trainning.

          <h3>Paragraph 3</h3>
            The paragraph discusses safety aspects related to alternative means of transport.
            However, some ideas could be expressed more clearly to strengthen the argument.
        </div>
        <div className="paragraph">
            One point to remark is that taking up some sport activities is easier than what people think. A common belief is that doing regular excersise
            implies hard work at gym, or running several kilometers per day. However, a simple 10-minutes walk is enough as a starting point; what is
            important finding an activity that appeals to us and, little by little, increase the amount of time we spent practising it.

          <h3>Paragraph 4</h3>
        The paragraph presents a counterargument regarding infrastructure for cyclists.
        It is insightful, but there are misspelled words that need to be addressed for better coherence.
        </div>
        <div className="paragraph">
            As a conclusion, it is clear that both students and think workers spent a lot of time sitting on they chairs, and that including
            some sports on their agenda is a must do. The good think is that finding an free-time activities that does not imply stay sitting
            in front of a screen will always be up to us.
        </div>
        <div className="feedback">
        <h3>Paragraph 5</h3>
        The conclusion summarizes the main points effectively and presents a clear opinion.
        The paragraph could be enhanced by providing more specific examples or statistics
        to support the argument.
