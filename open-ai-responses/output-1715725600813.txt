It's worth noting that the unique value that sports contribute to society lies mainly in entertainment; though significant, it is not crucial. In this essay, I will delve into these points and present my own perspective.\n\nFirstly, itâ€™s important to identify the essential roles within a society. It is inconceivable to imagine a functioning civilization without the presence of medical professionals and educators. Likewise, jobs linked to the production and distribution of food are critical for humanity. Despite the societal demand for entertainment, we can endure without sports. Surprisingly though, elite sportspeople garner some of the world's highest salaries.\n\nGiven our lack of dependence on sports for survival, why do some sportspeople earn exorbitant salaries? A plausible explanation lies in the immense revenues generated by the sports industry. Popular sports like football, tennis, and basketball serve as primary sources of diversion for billions, leading to sports events attracting massive audiences. Consequently, sponsors pay substantial sums to advertise their brands and products.\n\nParadoxically, society's pillars - such as the professionals mentioned earlier - often receive meager wages. There are reports of many countries where professionals like doctors, nurses, or teachers are among the lowest-paid, despite requiring higher education.\n\nIn conclusion, while I believe sportspeople are disproportionally compensated considering their societal contribution, the business machine behind them is vast. Moreover, their income principally comes from corporations, implying minimal societal impact. Therefore, while it may seem unfair, it is not a matter of immediate concern for society."
