In recent years, digital streaming platforms and social networks have simplified our experience of staying current with particular shows and sharing opinions about the participants. \n\nThese programmes are consciously crafted to be compelling and entertaining. They frequently offer insight into the personal lives of ordinary contestants, an element that contributes to their widespread popularity amongst viewers. Moreover, the inclusion of hard-life stories often makes the plot even more attractive to the audience.\n\nHowever, the impact these shows have on young audiences warrants attention. It's known that, in certain instances, the backgrounds of some show participants are fabricated. It's also apparent that the plot does not always portray the truth. This dishonesty risks misleading young fans into idolising individuals who are not as they portray themselves to be.\n\nI believe the influence of these shows on young viewers is the key point of discussion here. When a TV programme gains popularity, the content featured should be modified not merely to maintain viewer interest, but also to ensure its suitability for younger audiences including children and teenagers.\n\nUndeniably, TV shows serve as a valuable source of entertainment and are engineered to captivate audiences across all age groups. While I believe it's unnecessary to prohibit children from viewing these shows, it's vital that the content displayed respects everyone's viewing suitability."
