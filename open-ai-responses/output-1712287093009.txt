This problematic issue spurs citizens in major cities to explore alternative transport modes.  The rising popularity of bicycles as an economical and eco-friendly commuting option merits discussion and reflection.\n\nAn undeniable fact is the constant and seemingly unstoppable growth of motor vehicles on our urban streets leading to alarming levels of congestion. Recent statistics show that city drivers while commuting to work spend an average of nine hours per week mired in traffic.\n\nSafety widely factors in when considering transport modes. Notably, motorcycles and bicycles, despite safety precautions such as helmet-wearing, expose riders to the possibility of severe accidents. Adding to the danger is the perceived indifference of car drivers towards cyclists.\n\nOn the flip side, city councils of these metropolitans are infusing significant resources into developing cyclist-friendly infrastructures. For example, New York, Amsterdam, and Paris have doubled their bike lanes in recent years, while Buenos Aires and Berlin offer free bike sharing schemes across the city.\n\nTo conclude, I hold the view that cycling, given the manageable commuting distances and adherence to safety measures, serves as a commendable alternative. Beside alleviating traffic congestion, cycling also reduces greenhouse gas emissions and provides daily exercise. It progresses towards an environmentally responsible and health-beneficial commuting approach."
